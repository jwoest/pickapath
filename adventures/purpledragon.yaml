    You are a dragon, who lives in a cave at the top of a rocky mountain.  Your
    scales are a beautiful, deep purple; your teeth are curved daggers; and your
    breath can curdle milk at 20 yards.

    This morning, you step out of your cave into the crisp air of spring.  Fluffy
    clouds float lazily by on the breeze.  Far below in the green valley, you see
    the castle of the local king.
  choices:
    2: Fly down into the valley.
    3: Go back to sleep.

    You spread your wings and take flight, coasting on the spring breeze.  A curious
    eagle flys next to you for a while, until you turn and smile at it.  Your toothy
    grin must have scared it, because it gives a squawk and flaps away in a hurry.

    Looking down at the valley below, you see green pastures full of white sheep.  Your
    stomach makes rumbling noises, reminding you that you haven't had breakfast yet.

    Colorful banners flutter in the breeze on the castle towers.
  choices:
    4: Dive down and snatch a sheep for breakfast.
    5: Fly to the castle for a visit.

    Stupid sunny day.  It's way too nice for a fierce and grumpy dragon such as
    yourself.  You head back into the darkness of your cave and lie down on your bed.
    Maybe tomorrow's weather will be more suitable; maybe dark clouds and lightning.
    Before long, the sound of your snores shakes the cave walls.

    You are awakened by the sound of voices coming from the cave entrance.  Whoever it
    is is whispering, and you can't quite make out what they're saying.
  choices:
    6: Wait and see who it is.
    7: Invaders!  Breathe fire down the cave and burn whoever is invading.

    You dive down steeply and grab an unsuspecting sheep in a taloned claw.  The other
    sheep (and a terrified shepherd) flee as you settle down on the grass to eat your
    breakfast.

    The sheep is delicious.  You belch (scorching the grass in the process) and
    then take to the air again.
  choices:
    5: Fly to the castle for a visit.

    You land again in the courtyard of the castle.  No one needs to announce your
    visit (it's pretty obvious when a large purple dragon is sitting in your castle),
    and soon the heavy front doors of the tower burst open.  The king's daughter runs
    into the courtyard and throws her arms around your long neck.

    "I'm so glad you came to visit today!" she exclaims.  "What should we do?"
  choices:
    8: |- 
      "Get your kettle - it's a beautiful day for a tea party!"
    9: |-
      "Don your helmet and sword - let's go harrass the sheep!"

    You pretend to be asleep as the voices in the cave get closer.  Suddenly it gets
    very quiet.  You are just about to open your eyes to see what's going on when -

    "Surprise!"

    Your eyes snap open, and you see your friend the princess standing there with the
    other girls from her royal entourage.  They've come up the mountain to have a
    surprise party for you.  There's no reason for it - they just felt like throwing
    you a party.

    You spend the rest of your day eating cake and drinking punch, and watching the
    princess and her friends swim around in your great piles of treasure.

    You open your mouth wide and send a bellyfull of firey death towards the cave
    entrance.  There's a breif yell of surprise, and then silence.

    You clomp to the cave entrance to see what's left of whoever it was.  All you see
    is a slightly melted suit of armor and a pile of ash.  That's one knight who won't
    be bothering you again!

    You settle back down to sleep, and dream wonderful dreams of little knights roasting
    on skewers.

    The princess squees in delight.  With a clap of her hands, she orders the royal
    servants to set up for a tea party in the castle garden.  You settle yourself down
    at the table, crushing only a few of the garden's delicate flowers in the process.
    
    You and the princess spend the rest of your day drinking tea and discussing the
    latest trends in ball gowns ("blech - so pink this year!") and making rude noises
    with your armpits.

    The princess runs back into the tower, and returns wearing a battered pail with eye
    holes as a helmet and and carrying a wooden sword.  You lift her onto your back and
    with a few beats of your wings you are both airborn and heading towards the
    sheep pastures.

    This is a game that you and the princess have played many times before, and the
    shepherds all roll their eyes when they see you coming.  But there's nothing they
    can do as you land on the grass and begin playfully nipping at the sheep while the
    princess tries to whack them with her sword.  The two of you spend the rest of the
    day chasing sheep and laying on your back watching the clouds.
